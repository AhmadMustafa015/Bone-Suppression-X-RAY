#TODO: 1- Select images only < 1mm slice thickness
#TODO: 2- Use interpolation to convert the voxels into isotropic voxels.
#TODO: 3- Project the image into 2D plane on the antroposterior direction.
#TODO: 4- Non-Linear transformation for the pixels into the XRAY intensity.
#TODO: 5- Bone enhancement; the bones in Xray are clearer than the ones in CT.
#TODO: 6- Unsharp masking process to control the image sharpness in compared to the Xray images.
#TODO: 7- Normalize the image to be between 0 and 1023. The generated image is 10 bit image.
